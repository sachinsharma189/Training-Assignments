        Park City native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the best long-distance
        runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course record
        set last year by Sarah Rawlings.

        Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished second and third, respectively. Laura's victory came on the heels of
        her performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado
        State.

        In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's marathon for
        the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Kyle Wills of
        Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu of Cutler,
        Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.
